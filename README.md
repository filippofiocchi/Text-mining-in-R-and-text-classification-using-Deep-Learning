# Text-mining-in-R-and-text-classification-using-Deep-Learning

I worked with the yelp reviews dataset in R, after cleaning , plotting and analyzing the data I used 4 deep learning models in order to classify the reviews in bad or good.
The code for the data mining is in the script.R file, while the code for the neural networks is in the model.R, and in the jupinter notbook file .Ipynb using R, I run the code and comment the plots and other output.
